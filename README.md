The primary goal of  is to survive your dynasty. The game begins by selecting a character to play sometime between the start dates of 769-1337 AD.. The game always ends in 1453.

You'll die many times, but as long as you still have an hei within your dynasty to succeed you, you'll continue to play. 

The game ends when you receive your "final score",  which is some numerical evaluation of the legacy of your dynasty. **This number is inconsequential**. You receive this score on two occasions:

1. You die, and have no more dynasty members that can succeed you. 
1. Your dynasty survives until 1453, and the game ends naturally.

The win/loss condition, unlike other games of its type, is **not** defined by the end-state of the game.

**The game is lost in practice when:** You put yourself in such a shitty position that you feel it's time to start over, or your dynasty is destroyed by fate.

**The game is won in practice when:** You succeed in achieving whatever goals you put in place for yourself when roleplaying your characters.

The flexibility and emergent nature of the gameplay means that many different styles are possible, which makes the game hard to learn and leads people to describe it as inaccessible. CK2 is just like any other game once you internalize its systems, and more importantly, familialize with its expected strategies. In fact, it exposes more of its underlying system than many other games.

**CK2 is set apart from others within its genre with:** 

- **The win condition.** For the purposes of your play, the win condition will be represented by fulfillingyour own personal win conditions. This sort ot dynamic goal-forming as you play is one of the things that makes it unique. 
- **Trusting you to strategize yourself.** Since there is such a significant variety of approaches and goals in the game and no true singular win condition, as well as being defined by histoly and unpredictable events, the tutorial is not vety valuable past explaining what all the HUD elements are and the basic diplomatic and war mechanics. Assume that you'll be figuring it out as you go a lot of the time. 
- **Having a steep learning curve.** In this context, that means it takes probably 5-10 hours of your time to really reach an understanding where you can begin to strategize and plan effectively. The difficulty level of Crusader Kings lies exclusively in your ability to strategize. All of the actual statistics and values are exposed at a surface level.
